WOOD (William's Object Oriented Database)-----------------------------------------Bill St. Clairbill@cambridge.apple.comWood is a persistent object store for MCL. Its goal is to providea way to save/restore Lisp objects to/from disk. A secondary goal isto remain as simple as possible so that it can be completed in a fewmonths.This document is is intended to be a starting point for using Wood.A more complete document may appear later, but hey, you've got sourcecode.Wood's file format is new. It is not intended to be compatible withanything. A Wood file is called a persistent heap.A persistent heap has one distinguished root object. All objects in theheap must be accessible from the root. Users may want to build otheraccess mechanisms on top of this. For instance, you may prefer tocreate unique identifiers, enter them in an index, and make the indexbe the root object of the persistent heap.My plans for Wood 1.0 are to support nested transactions and recovery forsingle-user access. Later versions may add multi-user support. Thetransaction log operates at the block file I/O level. It knows nothingabout Lisp objects. Object locking has disk page resolution. A disk pagedefaults to 512 bytes, but this is a parameter of persistent heapcreation.Wood files can be as large as 4 gigabytes, but file sizes over 256 megswill cons lots of bignum addresses.B*-trees are used for indexing. EQ hash tables are implemented on top ofthe B*-trees.Consing areas provide some user control over making related objectsclose to each other on disk. This is an idea from the Lisp machine.Basically, each of the consing primitives takes an optional areaparameter telling where to create the storage.This version must be garbage collected off-line. Future versions maysupport incremental garbage collection if there is great demand andI have time.What is finished in this version--------------------------------This is version 0.8. See the file "@Release Notes 0.8" for new featuresand a list of bug fixes. The most noticeable new feature is a simplegarbage collector.I do not presently have time to work on anything but bug fixes forWood.I have done quite a few consers, predicates, and accessors. I'll do moreas I need them and people ask for them. They're usually quite easy.P-LOAD & P-STORE work for all Lisp objects.The B*-trees work (I needed them for interning symbols). All of the other P-xxxfunctions described below work except where noted.I have decided to do a simple undo/redo transaction log. It requires thatthe log be forced any time an uncommitted page is written to disk (seethe "Questions" section below).I have not yet defined functions for saving/restoring Mac heap objects.Alan Ruttenberg suggested as stream-based protocol for transferring bytesto/from largish persistent objects containing random bytes.I have not yet made a background function to flush dirty pages whileyour machine is idle.There should be a print-object method for PPTR's that tells at leasta little bit about the type and size of the object.How to load WOOD----------------Wood will work in MCL 3.x or 4.xTo load Wood (assuming the "WOOD" folder is a sub-folder of your "CCL"folder):   (require "WOOD" "ccl:wood;wood")All of the WOOD functions are exported from the package named "WOOD".Note that because there is no recovery yet and because I haven't putWITHOUT-INTERRUPTS or UNWIND-PROTECT in some of the places that need it,crashing your machine or aborting at the wrong time may corrupt yourpersistent heap.(defun test-pheap ()  (unless (directory "temp.pheap")    (let* ((pheap (wood:open-pheap "temp.pheap" :if-does-not-exist :create))           (a (wood:p-make-array pheap 10)))      (setf (wood:root-object pheap) a)      (dotimes (i 10)        (setf (wood:p-aref a i) (list i)))      (wood:close-pheap pheap)))  (let* ((pheap (wood:open-pheap "temp.pheap"))         (a (wood:root-object pheap)))    (dotimes (i 10)      (let ((value (print (wood:p-load (wood:p-aref a i)))))        (unless (and (listp value)                     (eql (car value) i)                     (null (cdr value)))          (cerror "Continue."                  "SB: ~s, WAS: ~s" (list i) value))))    (wood:close-pheap pheap)))The file "example.lisp" contains a more extended example.Opening and Closing persistent heaps------------------------------------A persistent heap is represented by an instance of the PHEAP class.OPEN-PHEAP filename &key if-does-not-exist if-exists read-only-p                    area-segment-size page-size max-pages  Open a persistent heap from filename.  IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST defaults to :error  IF-EXISTS defaults to :overwrite  READ-ONLY-P defaults to nil  AREA-SEGMENT-SIZE is the default allocation block size for consing areas  PAGE-SIZE defaults to 512  MAX-PAGES defaults to (ceiling 100000 page-size)   I.e, the disk-cache for this persistent heap will keep   up to 100000 bytes of the file in memory.  Returns the PHEAP instance. AREA-SEGMENT-SIZE and PAGE-SIZE will be  ignored if the file already exists.CLOSE-PHEAP pheap  Close the persistent heap after flushing any unwriten blocks  to disk. Quitting from MCL will close any open persistent heaps,  though (after recovery is implemented) it will not abort active  transactions (this will be done the next time the persistent heap  if opened).WITH-OPEN-PHEAP (pheap filename &rest options) &body body  WITH-OPEN-PHEAP is to OPEN-PHEAP & CLOSE-PHEAP as  WITH-OPEN-FILE is to OPEN & CLOSE. E.g. execute BODY with  PHEAP bound to the result of calling OPEN-PHEAP with the  FILENAME and the OPTIONS. Call CLOSE-PHEAP on exiting the  dynamic-extent of the WITH-OPEN-PHEAP form, whether normally  or abnormally.ROOT-OBJECT pheap  Return the root object of the given persistent heap. This will be a  PPTR (see below) unless the root is an immediate object (why anyone  would save an immediate object as the root I can't imagine).(SETF ROOT-OBJECT) new-root pheap  Change the root object of PHEAP to NEW-ROOT.FLUSH-PHEAP pheap  Write all dirty pages to disk.Informational functions-----------------------PHEAP-STREAM pheap  Returns the stream that PHEAP is using for I/O. Writing to this  stream will likely corrupt the persistent heap.PHEAP-PATHNAME pheap  Returns the pathname for the file in which the persistent heap is stored.Garbage Collection------------------If you ever destructively modify an object stored in a persistent heap,you may create garbage. This will cause the disk file to be larger thanit really needs to be. Wood has a copying garbage collector that will getrid of this garbage making your persistent heap file as small as it canbe (given Wood's representation scheme). The 0.8 version of the garbagecollector does not handle multiple consing areas; the garbage collectedfile will contain a single consing area containing all the objects. Italso does not yet delete any entries from weak hash tables. Since it is acopying garbage collector, it creates a temporary file for the garbagecollected persistent heap. This means that in order to run the garbagecollector you will need to have sufficient disk space for two copies ofyour database. During garbage collection, the original persistent heapfile is overwritten with forwarding pointers. If you abort the garbagecollection, the overwritten data will be restored leaving your databaseintact. If your machine crashes during garbage collection, your databasewill likely be corrupted. Hence, it's a good idea to back up yourdatabase file before garbage collecting it.GC-PHEAP-FILE filenameGarbage collects the persistent heap stored in FILENAME. The file mustNOT be open. In System 7, uses #_ExchangeFIles to ensure that aliasesthat point at FILENAME will continue to work. Aborting this operationwill preserve the contents of the persistent heapAccess paradigms----------------Wood will support three access paradigms. This version supports theintermediate and low level access paradigms. Later versions may addsupport for real persistent objects.1. Real persistent objects==========================This level provides a persistent-object metaclass. Objects with thismetaclass are stored on disk. SLOT-VALUE reads a slot into memory(SETF SLOT-VALUE) writes a slot onto disk. At this level, the programmerno longer needs to worry about whether an object is persistent or not.The main reason I haven't done this yet is that MCL's CLOS implementationdoes not yet support SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS.2. Intermediate level access============================At this level, operations are done primarily on in-memory objects, andWOOD is used to transfer objects to and from disk. There is also supportfor large disk-based tables and arrays.The names of the operators at this level begin with "P-".There is usually a "P-" operator for each "DC-" operator in thelow level.Pointers into the persistent heap are represented by a PPTRinstance. PPTR instances are interned (in a weak hash table),so you will never cons more than one PPTR for a single disk address.Two weak hash tables cache the corresondence between objectsin memory and (tagged) addresses in the persistent heap.These operators try to be "smart" in that they will move objects frommemory to disk as necessary. Only P-LOAD conses disk objects in memory.All the other accessors return PPTR instances or immediate Lisp objects.Objects are copied between memory and disk with the following twofunctions.P-STORE pheap object &optional descend  Store the lisp OBJECT in the given persistent heap. DESCEND controls  what to do if an object that is already in the pheap is encountered:    :DEFAULT  the default. Recursive descent will stop when an object              that is already on disk is encountered.     NIL      recursive descent will stop as for :DEFAULT, but newly              consed objects will not be stored in the cache. This allows              storing of stack-consed or reuseable objects.     T        will do a complete recursive descent of the object possibly              overwriting values on the disk with updated values from memory.     :STORE-SLOTS-AGAIN              Like T except the overwriting only happens for the              first level of the object. Recursive descent operates              as with :default. Use this if you modify a slot of              a CLOS instance and want to ensure that storing it              updates the on-disk version. (setf (wood:p-slot-value ...) ...)              will also work for this.  P-STORE returns a PPTR (unless OBJECT is an immediate object that  requires no consing to store on disk, in which case OBJECT will be  returned). All disk consing will be done in the current area.  In order to prevent saving the entire Lisp heap, P-STORE does not  recursively descend symbols, packages, or classes. When P-STORE saves  a CLOS instance, it saves only the instance slots, class slots are  ignored.P-LOAD pptr &optional depth  Load an object from disk into memory. The depth argument controls  the depth to which the object will be converted to its in-memory  representation:    :DEFAULT  Recursively descends uvectors & conses stopping when it finds              cached values. This is the default.    NIL       Look the pointer up in the cache. Do no other conversion.    :SINGLE   Translates a single level.              E.g. will cons an array, but it's non-immediate components will              be PPTR's.    <fixnum>  Same as :SINGLE, but will do no conversion unless the length              of a vector is less than the depth value. Will also stop converting              a list when it becomes this long leaving a PPTR as the final CDR.    T         Converts all levels. If an object is encountered that              has already been converted, it's storage will be overwritten,              and possibly changed, by the values on disk.  When P-LOAD restores a CLOS instance it sets only the instance slots.  If there are class slots, they will get the default value (from the  DEFCLASS or INITIALIZE-INSTANCE method). Consers-------Values will be P-STORE'd as necessary.P-MAKE-AREA &key segment-size flags  Make a new consing area. SEGMENT-SIZE is the default size of a segment.  It will be rounded up to a multiple of the block size. FLAGS, a fixnum,  is currently unused, though it is stored in the area.WITH-CONSING-AREA area &body body  Macro. Executes BODY with the default consing area bound to the given AREA  (a PPTR as returned from P-MAKE-AREA).P-CONS pheap car cdr &optional areaP-LIST pheap &rest elements  Make a list in the default consing areaP-LIST-IN-AREA pheap area &rest elements  Make a list in an explicit area. The elements will be P-STORE'd in the  default consing area. If AREA is NIL, the default area will be used.P-MAKE-LIST pheap size &key initial-element area  Again, use the default consing areaP-MAKE-UVECTOR pheap length subtype &key initial-element area  Cons a uvector of the given length in the persistent heap. All data  types except fixnums, symbols, floats, cons cells, characters, &  some other internal immediate values are represented as uvectors.  The length must be a fixnum. The subtype is one of the $V_xxx values in  "WOODEQU.LISP". INITIAL-ELEMENT will default appropriately for vectors  that need to be initialized.P-MAKE-ARRAY pheap dimensions &key area element-type initial-element  Does not yet support initial-contents, adjustable, fill-pointer,  displaced-to, or displaced-index-offset.  You can, however, save, with P-STORE, a memory array made by MAKE-ARRAY  with those keywords.P-VECTOR pheap &rest elements  Cons the vector in the default consing area.Predicates----------P-LISTP objectP-CONSP objectP-ATOM objectP-UVECTORP objectP-PACKAGEP objectP-SYMBOLP objectP-STRINGP objectP-SIMPLE-STRING-P objectP-VECTORP objectP-SIMPLE-VECTOR-P objectP-ARRAYP objectAccessors---------P-CxR list(SETF P-CxR) value cons  These are supported for up to four levels.P-UVSIZE uvectorP-UVREF uvector index(SETF P-UVREF) value uvector indexP-SVREF simple-vector index(SETF P-SVREF) value simple-vector indexP-%SVREF simple-vector index(SETF P-%SVREF) value simple-vector index   Do no type or range checking. Use at your own risk.P-LENGTH list-or-vectorP-AREF array &rest indices(SETF P-AREF) value array &rest indicesP-ARRAY-RANK arrayP-ARRAY-DIMENSIONS arrayP-ARRAY-DIMENSION array dimensionSymbols and Packages--------------------P-INTERN pheap string &key package area  Will make a new persistent package if PACKAGE is a package or the  name of a package in memory.P-FIND-SYMBOL pheap string &optional package  This takes a PHEAP arg as it is common to want to look for a  symbol in the persistent heap without P-STORE'ing the string.P-FIND-PACKAGE pheap package  PACKAGE can be a package or package name (string or symbol) either  in memory or on the disk.P-MAKE-PACKAGE pheap name &key nicknames  Currently, persistent heap packages do not support inheritance or  external symbols. They are simply a way to associate a string  with a symbol. This is because of the problems of maintaining  two parallel package hierarchies (most of us have enough problems  with one).P-SYMBOL-NAME symbolP-SYMBOL-PACKAGE symbolP-SYMBOL-VALUE symbol(SETF P-SYMBOL-VALUE) value symbolP-PACKAGE-NAME packageP-PACKAGE-NICKNAMES packageP-STRING string-or-symbolBTREEs------P-MAKE-BTREE pheap &key area type  TYPE is currently unused.P-BTREE-LOOKUP btree key-string &optional default  The key-string must be a string. Comparison is done with string< & string=,  i.e. it is case sensitive.P-BTREE-STORE btree key-string value  You can also use SETF with P-BTREE-LOOKUPP-BTREE-DELETE btree key-string  Returns true if there was an entry for KEY-STRINGP-BTREE-COUNT btree  Returns the number of entries in the BTREE.P-CLEAR-BTREE btree  Remove all entries from the BTREE.P-MAP-BTREE btree function &optional from to  For each BTREE entry whose key is (if FROM is specified and non-NIL) >= FROM  and (if TO is specified and non-NIL) <= TO, calls FUNCTION with two  arguments: the key and its value. Deals correctly with insertion or deletion  during mapping. The first (key) argument to FUNCTION will be a  string allocated with dynamic-extent. Hence, if you wish to store  it anywhere for longer than FUNCTION's dynamic-extent you will need  to copy it (with, e.g., COPY-SEQ).P-BTREE-P btree  Returns true if BTREE is a btree.Hash tables---------------------------------P-MAKE-HASH-TABLE pheap &key test weak area  TEST must be EQ or #'EQ.  WEAK must be NIL (the default), :KEY, or :VALUE.P-GETHASH key hash-table &optional default(SETF P-GETHASH) value key hash-tableP-REMHASH key hash-tableP-CLRHASH hash-tableP-HASH-TABLE-COUNT hash-tableP-MAPHASH function hash-table  Deals correctly with insertion or deletion during mapping.P-HASH-TABLE-P hash-table  Returns true if hash-table is a hash table (either in-memory  or on disk).CLOS hooks----------There are some generic functions that allow you to customize the waythat WOOD saves/restores CLOS instance. You can decide to save/restoreonly a subset of an instance's slots and you can do conversion of theslot values on the way out/in.WOOD-SLOT-NAMES-VECTOR object  Returns a vector of the names of the slots to save. The default  method returns a vector containing the name of all the instance slots.  It is important that multiple calls to this generic function on  instances of the same class return the same (EQ) vector.WOOD-SLOT-VALUE object slot-name  Called for each slot of an instance when it is being saved to disk.  Allows you to convert the slot's value to some other form for being saved  in the persistent heap. The default method calls SLOT-VALUE.(SETF WOOD-SLOT-VALUE) value object slot-name  Called when an instance is being read into memory. Allows you to reverse  the conversion provided by WOOD-SLOT-VALUE. The default method calls  (SETF SLOT-VALUE).INITIALIZE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE instance  Called on a CLOS instance after it has been loaded from disk.  Specialize this generic function to add custom initialization code.Objects that call a function when P-LOAD'ed-------------------------------------------Sometimes you need more than just saving the data associated withone of your CLOS or structure instances. Wood has a hook very similarto Common Lisp's MAKE-LOAD-FORM to allow this.P-MAKE-LOAD-FUNCTION object                               [Generic Function]P-MAKE-LOAD-FUNCTION (object t)                           [Primary method]  Called when a CLOS or structure instance is P-STORE'd to disk.  The provided method returns NIL, meaning just save the slots normally.  If you write a method, it should return two values:  1) load-function.args  2) init-function.args  Each of these should be a list whose CAR is suitable as a first argument  to APPLY and whose CDR is suitable as a last argument to APPLY.  init-function.args can also be NIL to mean that there is no initialization  beyond consing the object.  (apply (car load-function.args) (cdr load-function.args))  should create a possibly empty copy of OBJECT, call it OBJECT-COPY.  (apply (car init-function.args) OBJECT-COPY (cdr init-function.args))  should fill in the slots of OBJECT-COPY.  The following example does the same thing as the default (but will  take up more space on disk):  (defclass foo ()    ((x :initarg :x)     (y :initarg :y)))  (defmethod p-make-load-function ((object foo))    (values '(allocate-instance-of-named-class foo)            `(set-slot-values (x y)                               (,(slot-value object 'x) ,(slot-value object 'y)))))  (defun allocate-instance-of-named-class (name)    (allocate-instance (find-class name)))  (defun set-slot-values (object slots values)    (loop      (unless slots (return))      (setf (slot-value object (pop slots)) (pop values))))P-MAKE-LOAD-FUNCTION-OBJECT load-function.args init-function.args  Allows you to explicitly create a LOAD-FUNCTION disk object.  P-LOAD'ing the result of this function will behave as follows:  (let ((object (apply (car load-function.args) (cdr load-function.args))))    (when init-function.args      (apply (car init-function.args) object (cdr init-function.args)))    object)3. Low level access===================This level is mostly used as the internals for implementingthe intermediate level. It can also be used by speed criticalcode.Values read or written at this level are either addresses (currentlyintegers) or immediate Lisp objects (fixnums, characters, shortfloats, and a few internal markers). Each piece of data has anassociated flag saying whether it is an address or an immediate.Hence, each reader at this level returns two values and each writertakes an optional "immediate?" flag (for each pointer argument). Itis very easy to corrupt a persistent heap by using the low levelaccessors. Usually, they are not what you want.All data is tagged in the low three bits. You will need to know aboutthese tags to use Wood at this level. They are defined in thefile "woodequ.lisp".The names of low-level accessors begin with "DC-" for "DISK-CACHE". ADISK-CACHE is the name of the data structure that controls cachedaccess to the bytes in the file. Transaction logging and recovery aredone at the DISK-CACHE level.DC-xxx functions exists for most of the P-xxx functions and a few more.Questions---------Should P-STORE allow the user fine-grained control over the consing area? If so, how should it do this?Three choices for the representation of (double) floats.  1) 8 bytes anywhere in memory.     This is the most space efficient, but makes it impossible     for a memory walker to distinguish floats and cons cells.     It will NOT cause the garbage collector any problems.     This is what the current implementation does.  2) Store as a vector. Requires 16 bytes per float.     (Float vectors will still need only eight bytes per entry).     This frees up a tag, but I have no use in mind for it.  3) Cons floats in a special area.     This requires only 8 bytes per float, but we need to allocate     a page full of floats at a time. This allows a memory walker     to distinguish floats and conses.P-INTERN currently creates a new package if a package with thatname exists in memory. Is this correct or should P-STORE beresponsible for that?2 choices for the first recovery method. I plan on redo-undorecovery with in-place database updating.1) Never force the log   Recovery requires scanning the entire log since the last backup   to restore uncommitted modified blocks. The advantage is that   no unneccessary I/O is ever done during normal operation.2) Force the log whenever an uncommitted block is written to disk   This allows checkpointing and the log only needs to be scanned   (and maintained) back to the beginning of the transactions that   were active at the last checkpoint. This will reduce log space   and recovery time, but will require more disk-head movement during   normal operation (I think).I'm leaning towards option 2 at the moment. Remember that the log for option 1will tend to be 1.5 to 2 times as big as the persistent heap file (I think).How important is it to integrate disk-based objects with the Common Lisp typeand class system? Does this even make sense? Do I need to do P-TYPEP &P-TYPE-OF in other than the simple way (which may cons its brains out):(defun p-typep (thing type)  (typep (p-load thing) type))

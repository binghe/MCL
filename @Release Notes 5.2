RMCL 5.2 RELEASE NOTES


RMCL 5.2 requires OSX 10.3 or later. It runs on both Intel and PPC processors. 

Unicode Support
---------------

Text in Fred is Unicode (UTF16). 

Strings read from files or typed by the user are Unicode. 
The types base-string (8 bits per character) and extended-string(16 bits per character) still both exist. 
A string may be a base-string if all the UTF16 character codes
are <= #xff, i.e in ASCII/Latin1 range.

Of course, the function ccl::convert-string can create a string in any encoding.
In that case it is up to the user to keep track of the encoding by
creating an encoded string (ccl::make-encoded-string) or simply knowing the intended 
usage of the result.

Fred files may be saved as Mac encoded (as always) or as UTF!6 or UTF8.
If saved as UTF16 or UTF8 the appropriate BOM (byte order mark) will
be placed at the beginning of the file. If saved as UTF16 the mac-file-type
will be set to :|utxt|.
When inserting a file in Fred, the BOM if any is heeded as is the file-type
:|utxt|. The same is true when compiling or loading a source file.

There is also the option to save with "Unix line endings". All carriage
returns in the Fred buffer will be changed to linefeeds prior to
writing the content. Note that this is blind substitution. The
content is not parsed. After all, it may not be a Lisp file.

Copy and Paste handle Unicode style (:|ustl| = #$kScrapFlavorTypeUnicodeStyle ) 
as well as Unicode text (:|utxt| = #$kScrapFlavorTypeUnicode).
Copy does put-scrap of :TEXT, :|utxt|, :|styl|, and :|ustl|.
Paste heeds :|utxt| and :|ustl| if available, else uses :TEXT and :|styl| if available.


Menu-title, menu-item-title, window-title, control-title, ... all work with Unicode titles.

One issue is that char-upcase or char-downcase of a UTF16 character
is not always one character.
For char-upcase this happens for 75 chars out of 834 non-ascii lower case characters
- some are 3 characters long.
The hack of the day is to return two values - the input character and a string containing the true 
upper case representation.
For char-downcase this happens for 1 character, uppercase I with a dot.
In this case two values are returned, lowercase i and a string of lower case i followed by "diacritic
non spacing dot above"
Similarly nstring-upcase, nstring-downcase, and nstring-captitalize cannot always 
destructively modify the given string because the required length may be different.
If that is the case a new string is returned. Nstring-upcase and nstring-capitalize
will also return a new string if the input string is a base string containing 
#\µ or #\Ø (lower case y umlaut). In that case, although the length is the same,
the result must be an extended-string.

Drawing text
--------------

Becuase strings in MCL 5.2 are Unicode, drawing strings that
contain  non 7bit-ascii characters using e.g.
(with-pstrs ((sp string start end))
  (#_drawstring sp))
will not do the right thing. #_drawstring and #_drawtext expect a Mac encoded string
whose encoding/script corresponds to the encoding/script implied by the font in effect
in the current grafport. The same applies to usage of #_stringwidth and #_textwidth.

 
Instead use any of the following to draw strings.

grafport-write-string (string start end &optional ff ms color)  
   - optional args ff ms and color are new in MCL 5.2, string can contain multiple lines.

 If ff, ms, and color are nil the values used are those of the current grafport.
 Text position is determined by the pen position in the current grafport.
 The vertical position of the pen determines the baseline of the first line of text.
 Drawing is done using #_ATSUDrawText.

Use font-codes-string-width or font-codes-string-width-with-eol if you need to measure
text that will be drawn with grafport-write-string.

draw-string-in-rect (string rect
                                &key
                                (start 0)(end (length string))
                                truncation justification compress-p
                                ff ms color)
 - new function, string can contain multiple lines

Draw a string in a rectangle in the coordinates of the current focused view. 
Draws using #_ATSUDrawText.

Start and end specify the range of the string to draw.

Truncation can be one of
:none or NIL  - dont truncate
:start 
:center or :middle  
:end

Justification can be one of
:none or :left or NIL
:center or :middle
:end or :right

If compress-p is true, the text is squished/squashed/compressed if truncation
other than :none or NIL is also specified.

If ff, ms, and color are nil the values are obtained from the current grafport.

Use font-codes-string-width or font-codes-string-width-with-eol to measure text
that will be drawn with draw-string-in-rect. 

draw-theme-text-box (text rect &optional (text-justification #$tejustcenter)
                              truncwhere (active-p t))

Draws using #_DrawThemeTextBox.

The active-p argument is new in MCL 5.2b5. If nil the text is drawn somewhat gray,
otherwise is drawn in the fore-color of the current grafport. 
String can contain multiple lines.
Uses ff and ms of current grafport.
Use font-codes-string-width-for-control to measure.

Added function grafport-write-char which can be used instead of #_drawchar

By the way, the text/transfer mode in ms has no effect when drawing with ATSUI.

Text drawing functions use #_ATSUSetTransientFontMatching which enables automatic font substitution.
"Transient font matching allows ATSUI to automatically substitute
glyphs from other fonts if the specified styles do not contain
glyphs for all the characters in the text."
Thanks to Takehiko Abe.

Inline input for CJK keyboards
-----------------

Added class tsm-document-mixin which results in making the object a #_NewTSMDocument
when installed in a window.

Tsm-document-mixin enables inline input for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboards.
Also enables Hebrew and Arabic in the keyboard menu, though those do not yet work
correctly. The typed text draws correctly but the blinking caret does
not appear in the correct place.

The classes tsm-fred-item and fred-dialog-item include tsm-document-mixin.
Fred windows use tsm-fred-item.

Thanks to Takehike Abe <keke@gol.com>

CarriageReturn vs. Linefeed
-----------------

In MCL 5.2  the characters #\return (carriage return - (code-char 13)), 
#\linefeed (line feed - (code-char 10)), (code-char #x2028) (aka line separator),
and (code-char #x2029) (aka paragraph separator) all serve the same purpose,
possibly to end a comment that begins with semicolon, and always to cause the succeeding
text to be drawn on the next line.
However, some users wish to share text files with applications that handle
only one or the other character as end of line. Also CVS and other source code
control systems  may be confused unless line endings are consistent.
To deal with the issues we have the special variable *preferred-eol-character*:

 if the value is #\linefeed then all carriage returns in a Fred buffer are changed to
 #\linefeed when the buffer is written to a file.

 If the value is #\return then all #\linefeeds in a Fred buffer are changed to #\Return when
the buffer is written to a file.

 If the value is anything else, then no substitution occurs when the file is written.
(unless "Unix line endings" is chosen from the format popup in the Choose File dialog,
in which case all occurrences of #\return are changed to #\linefeed)

If the value of *preferred-eol-character* is #\linefeed then typing the return key
will result in inserting #\linefeed in a fred-buffer.

The initial value of *preferred-eol-character* is NIL.

As far as CRLF line endings are concerned the only support occurs on opening
a file in a Fred window, primarily so the content is easier for the user to view.

The special variable *transform-CRLF-to-preferred-eol* if true
will cause all instances of #\return followed by #\linefeed to be transformed
to  a single character in the Fred buffer.
If *preferred-eol-character* is #\linefeed
then CRLF -> #\linefeed
else CRLF -> #\return

The initial value of  *transform-CRLF-to-preferred-eol* is NIL.

If any of the transformations is attempted and finds it actually needs to
make a change in a read-only Fred buffer, the "Modify read only" dialog will be invoked.

Please note that all of the above transformations are "blind"
so source code strings containing #\return or #\linefeed may be modified.
That may be a bad thing, a good thing, or neutral depending on the intended usage
of the strings.

There are two very simple new functions in MCL 5.2,
char-eolp and char-code-eolp which are frequently useful as
replacements for (eq char #\return) or the character code equivalent.
The symbols are exported from the :ccl package.

Added line separator and paragraph separator to the variables wsp&cr and symbol-specials.Proxy Icon---------Fred windows have a proxy icon in the title bar.The  proxy icon behaves in the "standard" way when clicked. Command-click in the proxy icon or the window title
shows a pop-up menu of the directory hierarchy
from which one can activate the Finder showing the chosen directory.
Click and drag on the proxy icon allows dragging the Fred file to another folder.
If one later saves or reverts the file it will be to/from the new location.If the referenced file has been moved or renamed:
   Command-click in the ProxyIcon will notify of the rename, and
   will change the window title.
   Window-save  will ask if you wish to save to new location, 
   original location, or cancel.
  If the file has been moved to trash it is deemed deleted.

Added methods application-pathname-to-window-title as follows:

(defmethod application-pathname-to-window-title ((app lisp-development-system)
                                                 (window fred-window)
                                                 pathname)
  (pathname-to-window-title pathname nil)  ;; include directory info
  )


(defmethod application-pathname-to-window-title ((app application)
                                                 (window window)
                                                 pathname)
  (pathname-to-window-title pathname t)  ;; omit directory info
  )

Fred window title-------------
Application-pathname-to-window-title is called by MCL Fred functions to determine how to represent
the file name in the window title. The returned value should be a string.

The function pathname-to-window-title now takes an optional argument. If true
directory information will be omitted. The default value is *pathname-window-title-name-only*,
the initial value of which is NIL.






Interfaces
-----------

The Pascal interface translator has been rewritten to translate C headers.
The Interfaces included with MCL 5.2 are translations of the OSX 10.3 headers.
This may require some changes to existing code. 
"OLDROUTINENAMES" are no longer included.

There are a few header files that have not been translated, mostly pertaining to
Perl, Java, Python and c++.

There is more explanation due here. For example one can write:

(#_CGRectGetMaxX 1.0s0 1.0s0 2.0s0 2.0s0)
or
(rlet ((foo :CGPoint :x 1.0s0 :y 1.0s0)
       (bar :CGSize :width 2.0s0 :height 2.0s0))
  (#_CGRectGetMaxX :CGPoint foo :CGSize bar)) 
or
(rlet ((blitz :CGRect 
              :origin.x 1.0s0
              :origin.y 1.0s0
              :size.width 2.0s0
              :size.height 2.0s0))              
  (#_CGRectGetMaxX :CGRect blitz))

To use #_uptime whose definition now is:

(deftrap-inline "_UpTime" 
   ((returnArg (:pointer :UnsignedWide))
    
   )                                            ; AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER
   nil
() )

do:
(rlet ((thetime :unsignedwide))
  (#_UpTime thetime)
  (unsignedwide->integer thetime))

Or to use #_CGRectIntegral whose definition now is:
(deftrap-inline "_CGRectIntegral" 
   ((returnArg (:pointer :CGRect))
      ;  :cgpoint
    (x :single-float)
    (y :single-float)  ;  :cgsize
    (width :single-float)
    (height :single-float)
   )
   nil
() )

do:
(rlet ((outrect :CGRect))
  (#_CGRectIntegral outrect 12.2s0 9.3s0 3.0s0 4.5s0))

or:
(rlet ((outrect :CGRect)
       (inrect :CGRect 
               :origin.x 12.2s0
               :origin.y 9.3s0
               :size.width 3.0s0
               :size.height 4.5s0))
  (#_CGRectIntegral outrect :CGRect inrect))
  

Mach-O support
---------------

As a first step in making MCL a Mach-O application rather than a CFM
application, "traps" are looked up in Mach-O frameworks rather than
CFM shared libraries. 
This happens if the variable ccl::*dont-use-cfm* is true at compile time.
The initial value is T.
Of the roughly 600 "traps" that MCL uses, 1 is accesed via the CFM shared library
CarbonLib. The rest are found in the Mach-O framework 
"Carbon.framework"
We also will look in "System.framework", "ApplicationServices.framework" and "AGL.framework"
if need be. To add to the list of possible frameworks, see the function all-bundles
in "ccl:l1;l1-init.lisp".


This may require some changes to existing code.
For example:

(add-pascal-upp-alist 'activate-proc #'(lambda (procptr)(#_neweventhandlerupp procptr)))
(defpascal activate-proc ... )

should be changed to:

(add-pascal-upp-alist-macho 'activate-proc "NewEventHandlerUPP")
(defpascal activate-proc ...)

Case matters in the string arg to add-pascal-upp-alist-macho.

Frameworks
-------------

Add-framework-bundle (framework-name &key pathname findfolder-args add-too) adds
to the frameworks to be looked in for function pointers or data pointers.

;; pathname if provided should be a lisp pathname to the folder containing the framework
;; findfolder-args if provided should be a list of 2 elements the vrefnum and foldertype to pass to #_fsfindfolder
;; it is an error to specifly both pathname and findfolder-args
;; if neither provided the default is to use (#_FSFindFolder #$kOnAppropriateDisk #$kFrameworksFolderType ...;;If add-to is true, the pathname or findfolder-args
;; will be added to a list of places to search for the framework-name.


Remove-framework-bundle (framework-name) removes knowledge of the named framework.
It dows not unload the bundle.


Alert dialogs
---------

Added function standard-alert-dialog which uses #_CreateStandardAlert and #_RunStandardAlert.
It is called by y-or-n-dialog and several other functions. It replaces previous uses
of message-dialog.Standard-alert-dialog has a :position keyword argument which defaults to
:front-window ( -> #$kWindowAlertPositionParentWindow). 
Other possibities are :center-front-window, :main-screen, or :center-main-screen.
Y-or-n-dialog calls standard-alert-dialog with :position :main-screen.
Button strings need not be simple strings. If message is not a string, coerce to same.
Allows keywords for alert-type.
 


Miscellaneous
---------

Added window-type :overlay-window

Window-ask-save uses #_NavCreateAskSaveChangesDialog.

Window-revert uses #_NavCreateAskDiscardChangesDialog.

Added functions xalphabetic-p, xupper-case-p, xlower-case-p, xalphanumeric-p, etc. 
which return T if the character argument is such.

Added Search/Replace to Tools menu.

All patches to MCL 5.1 have been included.

Some obsolete functions such as %path-to-iopb have been removed.




Lisp Heap
---------
The size of the Lisp heap has been increased by a small amount.

MCL 5.1
Lisp Heap:   955461632 (933068K)

MCL 5.2
Lisp Heap:  1025635480 (978.1 MB)

Bugs fixed
------------

Fixed sbit and (setf sbit) which are optimized versions of bit and (setf bit) for
accessing simple bit vectors. They didn't work at all.
Now function correctly. Very old bug.

Fixed VERY poor performance accesing an array of (unsigned-byte 32) elements
when result is a bignum.

Get Info dialog - when invoked with a selection in the frontmost Fred window,
the inserted text is drawn in the correct font.


Export *load-verbose* from CCL package.
Export *dont-use-cfm*.

Added 2 more characters to wsp&cr and symbol-specials - line separator and paragraph separator

Changes to time functions such as encode-universal-time 
so that daylight saving time is as determined by the OS rather
than MCL's function daylight-saving-time-p which is wrong for some countries and states.

Fix float type confusion. Many years ago MCL had 2 floating point types, short-float which
was an immediate value (like a fixnum) similar to IEEE single-float but with some precision
bits missing to make room for the immediate tag, and double-float which was an IEEE double
float. At that time the CommonLisp type short-float was imlemented as MCL's short-float. The CommonLisp
types single-float, double-float, and long-float were all implemented as MCL's double-float
(IEEE double-float).  With the advent of the PPC, MCL changed to using true IEEE single-float,
with the intention that CommonLisp short-float and single-float be 
implemented as MCL (and IEEE) single-float, and CommonLisp double-float and long-float
be implemented as MCL (and IEEE) double-float. Unfortunately, some confusion remained about
float types. For example, the initial value of *read-default-float-format* was 'single-float
but the actual effect was to use double-float. To actually read as single-float one had to
set *read-default-float-format* to 'short-float. And if the value of foo was 1.0s0,
(typep foo 'single-float) would return NIL. Hopefully all such confusion is eliminated
in MCL 5.2. The initial value of *read-default-float-format* is 'double-float which
has the intended effect. If *read-default-float-format* is 'short-float or 'single-float
float numbers with unqualified exponent will be read as MCL (and IEEE) single-float.

Fix float overflow and underflow behavior to be consistent with the desired FPU mode.
Initially (get-fpu-mode) returns:
(:ROUNDING-MODE :NEAREST :OVERFLOW T :UNDERFLOW NIL :DIVISION-BY-ZERO T :INVALID T :INEXACT NIL)
which has the effect that a floating point overflow will cause an error. Underflow will not error.
Fix float-underflow to return negative 0 (rather than positive 0)  when appropriate.

Opentransport.lisp
;; use CFM version of #_newotnotifyUPP

Navservices.lisp
Choose-new-file-dialog and choose-new-directory-dialog - :prompt default is NIL i.e.
omit the redundant "New file name ..." at the top of the dialog. 
Chose-new-directory-dialog - doesn't include Format pop-up which is meaningless for directories.Fix bug that coused a structure reference to nil to report the error as
"Unknown trap from kernel ..." rather than "value NIL is not of the expected type STRUCTURE".
Very old bug.





----------------

Release Notes MCL5.2b5




Modifications
----------


Window-save does :supersede vs :overwrite so errors less likely to be "fatal" to
the existing file content.

Bug fixes
----------------

Fix Preferences dialog when double-click in the table on a variable name that
has T or Nil value. Sometimes would "process" the double-click twice
so value would quickly change from T to NIL and back to T or vice versa.
Old bug.


Internalize-scrap ((handler text-scrap-handler)) - don't error if text-ptr NIL


%buffer-insert-file - error rather than crash if data fork and resource fork are seriously out of sync.
Shouldn't happen but has been known to occur at least once.


The internal function find-encoding-for-uchar has been slightly changed so that
the characters 1/4 1/2 3/4 will be saved correctly in Mac encoded files.
Also change for some greek characters such as alpha, beta ... for a similar reason.

Find-method fixed for eql specializers.
 (defgeneric fun (arg) (:method ((arg (eql 'a))) arg))
 (find-method #'fun nil '((eql a)))
works now, previously did not.
Old bug.


New features
----------

Pass arguments from records that contain single-floats to traps that expect single-floats without consing.

Window title for Fred window more likely to show logical pathname rather than full pathname.


Special variable *save-as-original-format* affects the format of a file written from Fred
via ctrl-x ctrl-s or cmd-s (any means that does not involve invoking a choose-file-dialog).
If *save-as-original-format* is T (the initial value), then if the file was originally 
utf16 or utf8 it will be saved in that format, otherwise in Mac encoded format.
If *save-as-original-format* is nil (and in the absence of a choice to the contrary from a choose-file-dialog)
the file will be saved in Mac encoded format.


Backwards incompatiblity
--------------

If a Fred file containing text in font/encoding "Symbol" or "Zapf Dingbats" is saved 
from MCL 5.2 it will not be read correctly in MCL 5.1
It is also the case that if a file containing fonts "Symbol" or "Zapf Dingbats" is saved 
from MCL 5.1, it will not be read as one might expect in MCL 5.2.

In MCL 5.1 the string "able" will be drawn as
the Greek characters alpha, beta, lambda, epsilon if the font is "Symbol" though
the string actually contains the 7bit-ascii characters
a, b, l, and e. In MCL 5.2, if you set the font to Symbol and press the "a" key
the character inserted is the Unicode "alpha" character the character code
of which is 945. In MCL 5.2 if you select text containing "able" and change
the font to Symbol, what will be drawn still looks like "able".
In MCL 5.2 the character code of a character determines what it "says"
(what you see), not a combination of the character code and the font used to draw it.



Warning Note
-------------

Saving Fred buffers to files in Mac encoded format can cause problems. 
There are many Unicode characters which cannot be represented in any Mac encoding.


Known bugs
-----------

In the interfaces files there are some record definitions that reference undefined
types. That occurs in record definitions that MCL users probably do
not need. But as a consequence the functions load-all-records, load-all-mactypes
and load-all-traps may error. 
As a workaround MCL 5.2b5 will warn and proceed if an error is
encountered. Hopefully the problem with undefined types will be fixed
in a future release.

Inserting Greek characters via the character palette does not work reliably. 
Typing with Greek keyboard does work.
Typing with US keyboard and the insertion font set to Symbol does work.

(rlet ((inrect :cgrect :origin.x 3.0s0 :origin.y 2.0s0 :size.width 1.2s0 :size.height 2.4s0))
  (rlet ((outrect :cgrect))
    (#_cgrectoffset outrect :cgrect inrect 1.0s0 2.0s0)))
does not produce the correct result in outrect.

nor does:
(rlet ((outrect :cgrect))
  (#_cgrectoffset outrect 3.0s0 2.0s0 1.2s0 2.4s0 1.0s0 2.0s0))

(#_cgrectgetmaxx :cgrect inrect) and (#_cgrectgetmaxx 3.0s0 2.0s0 1.2s0 2.4s0)
do work.




----------

5.2b6


Improvements
-------------



Fred Revert
 If file no longer exists, show a warning dialog and return rather than error.
 Also the warning dialogs for either file modified since last written/read or 
file deleted occur before asking if "you really want to discard changes", rather than after.

Fred Save
If file has been moved or renamed, ask if want to save as original pathname or new pathname.

Dialogs that include file names show logical pathnames rather than physical
pathnames when possible.



The feature whereby option-click in an arrow-dialog-item did Copy of the table-sequence
has been removed on the grounds that is non-intuitive and overloads the meaning of
the option key modifier.
For example, in the "Definitions of ..." dialog:
Option click on the  "Find it" button does the Find action and closes the dialog.
Double-click on an item in the table does the Find action for the clicked item.
Option double-click does the Find action and closes the dialog.
Previously option double-click or option single-click in the table would also Copy
the table-sequence which would overwrite any previous scrap that the
user might have created and wished to preserve.

Modify compilation of (incf (slot-value instance slot-name)) when slot-name is
known  at compile time. Resulting execution time is faster by a factor of 7.
(same applies to decf).

Slot-value and set-slot-value are faster.

FSOpen conses less.

Probe-file conses less.

Export draw-theme-text-box and draw-string-in-rect from CCL package.

Preferences - added *preferred-eol-character*, use y-or-n-dialog for warnings rather
than message-diaog.

Improve scrolling speed when mouse held down in the scroll-down or scroll-up button 
of a vertical scroll-bar in a Fred window.

In printed representation of pathnames referencing existing file system objects, alphabetic
case more likely to correspond to file system state (but not guaranteed).


Bug Fixes
----------

Fix Inspector bug when inspecting a string that is not a simple-string.

Compare/merge fixed to treat all eol characters as equivalent.

Ed-current/next-top-level-sexp - work for any eol character followed by #\(

Ed-indent-for-lisp and ed-indent-differently - fix so any eol character works.

Fix bug that could cause minor problems when saving a fred window after
splitting then unsplitting the window.


Fix bug if an item of class tsm-document-mixin (i.e. fred-dialog-item or
fred-item) was removed from a window, then reinstalled in
the same or different window.

Fix  bug in the type system which caused (typep :bar '(and keyword (member :foo :bar)))
to fail. (very old bug)

Fix bug that could result in a fred-dialog-item drawing outside it's bounds.

Fix handling of "quoted" characters in filenames. If the name of a file
on disk is "foo.bar.baz.lisp", it is represented internally as
name = "foo¶.bar¶.baz" , type = "lisp". Prior to MCL 5.2b6, the window
title for the file in Fred would include the ¶ quote characters and Save As ...
would use the name with quotes as the suggested file name. Now
the window title and suggested file name are shown as the name appears on disk.
As a more extreme example, a file named "¶foo.bar.lisp"
would previously cause an error when attempting to open it in Fred via a Choose File
dialog.

If deleting a temporary file fails (because Spotlight, Norton AntiVirus, or
some other application has it open), the warning message re: "file moved to trash ..."
no longer occurs. The move to trash is done quietly. 
In some situations if a delete fails, the
file is renamed (in the existing folder) to nnnnn.tem (where "nnnnn"
is a unique name) and left for posterity.

Fix compilation of calls to traps that expect an argument of type :ostype when an integer
value (most likely 0) is provided. The integer value is allowed.


Fix some bugs in drawing of theme focus rectangle and in resizing framed views

Char-code-limit = 65536 (was 65535).

Fix bug in where-to-word-wrap.

Package functions allow character as package-name.

Check for :allocation :instance or :class in some places.

Slot-id-value, set-slot-id-value fix to deal with non-standard wrapper or non-standard slotd.
Fix bug in slot-id->slotd when no map.

Count heeds from-end argument.

Check type of predicate in functions every, notevery, notany, and some.

Concatenate accepts cons as output-type-spec - same as list.

Remove - do check-count.



Fix defstruct for case (defstruct (sbt-11 (:constructor sbt-11-con (&aux a b)))  a (b 0 :type integer)).
Fix for conc-name provided NIL.

Fix to subst, ldiff, union - :key provided nil = > :key #'identity.

Use *preferred-eol-character* if non nil in a couple of places.
Function terminator-predicate handles eol.


Minor improvements and modifications
--------------

New varioble *use-app-resources* used by save-application. Initial value is T.

Lose need for subprims shared library.

Choose-new-file-dialog - user can provide format-query-p nil as another way to say no format popup.

Font-number-from-name faster in usual case.

Add support for resources in data fork. Open-resource-file, with-open-resource-file get data-fork-p arg.
Open-resource-file-from-fsref, %open-res-file2, fscreate-res-file get optional data-fork-p arg.

String comparisons heed *string-compare-non-literal*.  if true then e.g. (o-umlaut == o, umlaut).
Initial value is NIL.

String-upcase, downcase, and capitalize faster for non-ascii strings. 


Case-key-tester - don't want to descend list structure more than once.

Set-view-size/position for focus-rect-mixin - do nothing if unchanged.


Fred-dialog-item heeds part-color :text.

Draw-theme-text-box - faster in truncate case.

Set-cursor handles keywords for theme cursors from Terje N.
Cursors no longer in resource fork, *gc-cursor* is pointer not handle.

Add method print-object of periodic-task from Toomas Altosaar.

A pathname function conses less.

Require calls  choose-file-dialog with :button-string "Load"

Add some keyboard and processor types,

Slightly faster reader/writer methods.

Faster accessor methods.

Callers - finds callers in pascal functions containing closures.


Examples
--------

animated-cursor.lisp
;; - use #_SetAnimatedThemeCursor - no more resources

Standard-sheet-dialog.lisp
 new file for creating standard sheet

processes.lisp
 ;;; launch-application uses fsrefs, fix get-creator-path though still uses fsspec

fred-drag.lisp
;; handle :|utxt|
;; launch-app-with-docs use fsrefs, pretty much a copy of launch-application (in processes.lisp)

drag-aware-list.lisp
;; handle :|utxt|

grapher.lisp
;; fixes for opaque grafport

drag-and-drop.lisp
;;; %resolve-alias-handle-without-dialog uses #_FSResolveAliasWithMountFlags (so use fsref not fsspec) 
;;; drag-get-drop-location-as-path was wrong

contextual-menu-mixin.lisp
;;; *contextual-menu-cursor* is in MCL now

assorted-fred-commands.lixp
;; comment out autoloading-edit-definition - reader macros do it already
;; usages of #\newline => various eol functionsAdded bevel-button-dialog-item from Alex Repenning.Fix bugs in "ccl:examples;picture-files.lisp" and "ccl:examples;mouse-copy.lisp".
Modify clone-window in "ccl:examples;assorted-fred-commands.lisp" so the cloned window gets
a proxy icon.Updated "ccl:examples;anticipat-symbol-complete.lisp" fram Alex Repenning.

;; Modification History
;; dont use buffer-roman
;; standard-alert-dialog - schar -> char, if message not string, coerce to same - fn moved to dialogs
;; ------ 5.2b6
;; add method set-window-filename-simple
;; window-filename-from-fsref does #_removewindowproxy if fsref gone or in trash
;; window-save-as, set-window-filename and pathname-to-window-title - dont *use-namestring-caches*
;; ed-self-insert-maybe-lf fn of *preferred-eol-character*
;; standard-alert-dialog - position arg does something now
;; frec slot for fred-mixin gets :initform nil
;; lose part-color kludge for fred-mixin - it belongs with fred-dialog-item
;; pathname-to-window-title and window-save-as call %file-system-string
;; window-revert - dialog rather than error if file is gonzo, also ask if mod dates dont match
;; window-filename back to full-path vs logical-path - logical done in pathname-to-window-title
;; window-save-file - get external-format from window rather than calling utf-something-p
;; window-save - if file has moved, ask if want to save as original path or new path
;; window-filename-from-fsref - trash => gonzo
;; ed-indent-for-lisp and ed-indent-differently - fix so any eol char works
;; window-revert does ed-xform-crlf rather than doing it in buffer-insert-file, issues a warning if ed-xform-crlf did change
;; ed-xform-crlf returns t if did something else NIL, fred-initialize doen't do ed-xform-crlf - done elsewhere
;; paste does paste-styled-utxt
;; ----- 5.2b5
;; ed-xform-crlf heeds *preferred-eol-character*
;; ------- 5.2b4
;;  ; export standard-alert-dialog
;; window-save-as does #_removewindowproxy
;; *save-as-original-format* initially T, fiddle with window-save etal to obey it if user did not do a choose-file-dialog
;; window-save says :supersede vs :overwrite so errors less likely to be "fatal" to the file content.
;; maybe do  (%buffer-set-read-only (fred-buffer w) nil) sooner in window-save-as so ed-xform-xxx wont whine if invoked 
;; ed-xform-newlines etal do read-only-check
;; beware window-fsref gone bad - e.g. volume unmounted, file deleted etc.
;; standard-alert-dialog - add ability to type first char of button title to select as was done by old y-or-n-dialog
;; ------- 5.2b4
;; set-window-filename does back-translate-pathname
;; window-save and window-revert back-translate path-from-fsref
;; window-save-as loses old fsref if any, window-save uses fsref if exists in case someone moved the file unbeknownst to us
;; ed-self-insert - fix for font = macsymbol - 
;; *unix-devotee* => *unix-line-ending*
;; pathname-to-window-title gets an optional arg to maybe omit directory
;; ------ 5.2b3
;; add method ed-xform-CRLF, fred-initialize will do it if *transform-CRLF-to-carriageReturn* is true
;; get rid of :prompt "save file as ..." in calls to choose-new-file-dialog, heed chosen-format from nav popup in window-save-copy-as
;; export standard-alert-dialog
;; ----- 5.2b1
;; (setf fred-word-wrap-p) enables or disables the horizontal scroll bar if it exists
;; window-save-as - don't copy the resource fork - seems to cause problems and if a fred file has other resources it should be handled elsewhere?
;; add variable *save-as-original-format* to save as whatever it was
;; add method ed-self-insert-maybe-LF - fn of *unix-devotee*
